Hi!
This was my first project for my It Coding class.

This scenario involves handling files, implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and
performing operations such as managing patient appointments, processing dental treatments, and handling
patient records.

#### Operations:
1. **Patient Management:**
- Create a file ‘patients_dentist.txt‘ that contains information about patients at the dentist’s studio.
- Read the file and create a list of ‘Patient‘ objects.
- Implement a notebook (‘patient_management_dentist.ipynb‘) with a menu that allows the following operations:
- Display the list of patients.
- Add a new patient to the studio.
- Delete a specific patient.
- Update contact details or dental history.
- Save the list to a file (this will update on disk any change you made).
- Quit the notebook.

2. **Appointment Management:**
- Create a file ‘appointments_dentist.txt‘ that contains information about scheduled appointments at the
dentist’s studio.
- Read the file and create a list of ‘Appointment‘ objects.
- Implement a notebook (‘appointment_management_dentist.ipynb‘) with a menu for the following operations:
- Display the list of appointments.
- Schedule a new appointment for a patient.
- Reschedule or cancel a specific appointment.
- Save the list to a file (this will update on disk any change you made).
- Quit the notebook.

3. **Treatment Processing:**
- Create a notebook (‘treatment_processing_dentist.ipynb‘) that:
- Reads both ‘patients_dentist.txt‘ and ‘appointments_dentist.txt‘.
- Allows the dentist to record treatments for patients, updating the patient’s dental history and completing
the appointment.
- Simulate the events:
- The dentist records the completion of a treatment for a patient after the appointment.
